# MDCG Project

## thing

hai ! :3

this is my little project thing that gives desmos a slightly more "[material 3 expressive](https://youtu.be/n17dnMChX14)" style similar to google's design thing

i started making this sometime in august 2025 and it is because of all the support and feedback from  the desmos discord server that im able to continue this project to keep improving it to try to make it better \<3 

especially silostunt who helped make the script.js so that the colors could update automatically using your desmodder primary color which is very cool

## Instructions

### apply thing

hi this is how to apply the thing

im using the [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension to inject css and js

for the css you can paste this code in the css section
```css
@font-face {font-family: 'mdcg-icons';src:url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/beta-B/mdcg-icons/mdcg-icons.woff') format('woff'),url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/beta-B/mdcg-icons/mdcg-icons.woff2')format('woff2');}
@import url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/main/theme.css');
```

for the script, for now you can only copy the whole script from script.js and paste it into the javascript section

### light/dark mode

to switch between light and dark mode, make it so the first line of the javascript says `const darkMode = false;` for light mode, and `const darkMode = true;` for dark mode
