# MDCG Project

## thing

hai ! :3

this is my little project thing that gives desmos a slightly more "material expressive 3" style similar to google's design that probably hasnt fully released yet idk man

i started making this sometime in august 2025 and thanks to all the support and feedback from yall in the desmos discord server i was able to continue this project to keep improving it to try to make it better \<3 

especially silostunt who helped make the script.js so that the colors could update automatically using your desmodder primary color which is very cool

## Instructions

### apply thing

hi this is how to apply the thing

im using the [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension to inject css and js

for the css you can paste this code in the css section
```css
@font-face {font-family: 'mdcg-icons';src:url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/c21e81dab4dad5e01d2107bc65968c18882c8049/mdcg-icons/mdcg-icons.woff') format('woff'),url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/c21e81dab4dad5e01d2107bc65968c18882c8049/mdcg-icons/mdcg-icons.woff2')format('woff2');}
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');
@import url('https://raw.githack.com/htest-311429731023102/mdcg-project/main/theme.css');
```

for the script, for now you can only copy the whole script from script.js and paste it into the javascript section

### light/dark mode

to switch between light and dark mode, make it so the first line of the javascript says `const darkMode = false;` for light mode, and `const darkMode = true;` for dark mode
